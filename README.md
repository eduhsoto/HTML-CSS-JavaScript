Update 2.2 https://lnkd.in/g8fWCtTg

Hi, I have finally finished this phase, although it took me some time. The purpose was to make two architectures without framework, to understand a little of the logic of how it works internally.

1. The spa architecture, website for Tania Raquel Jimenez Marquez , here you can see https://lnkd.in/gnp6aXVA as it is known using client side rendering and to have it on the web, using server side rendering. This architecture using only vanilla JS, was very complicated, plus the router, we looked at some examples, and from there we came up with our own version. What I found more difficult, was the router and the history state. For the web components, the w3c htmlelement standard was used. 
I tried to implement the ssr in vercel, although I didn't know how to pre render the other pages, I left it as always redirect to the start.  I think the framework is where it makes this easier. 

2. The mpa architecture, website for Debora Migliani, here you can see it https://lnkd.in/gQCNRYcF using php for the server, and by itself the server-side rendering, although from what I saw, there are already more types of rendering or subrendering on the web, either for client or server. Implementing this one was easier, at least that I felt, it took me less time than the spa, but the styles did take me time, here I used the mvc pattern. For the contact form I used Ajax, with fetch, both in the javascript and php the corresponding validations were made, in php I sent the answers in json, so that in javascript it will be handled. If the change of language stunned me a little, the scope for example, while in javascript there are three types I think, in php there is only one, and I had to global so that the variable has scope inside the scope of functions.
